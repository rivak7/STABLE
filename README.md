# STABLE: SubTropical Atmospheric ridge and BLocking Events

The tracking outputs are available at <https://orca.atmos.washington.edu/~bkerns/rishabh/blocking_climatology/tracking/>. The most recent run in `/Output_data/` uses the same `namelist_input.txt` input parameters as provided in this repo. 

(STABLE has been renamed from a previous version, from BLOCS)

An open-source and user-friendly Python algorithm for detecting and tracking atmospheric blockings and subtropical ridge obstruction events.
This is a working copy in python 3.9 of the methodology presented in [Sousa et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0658.1). Some alterations are available as a namelist_input.txt file.

# What do I need to get and run STABLE?

## To run STABLE, you need

   * [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)
   * [![Git: ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git--blue)](https://git-scm.com/)

and

 * [![Anaconda 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-3-green.svg)](https://www.anaconda.com/) (or similar to manage python packages)

or

  *  [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org) and the required modules on a cluster

## The packages required to run STABLE are:
  
```
- numpy
- xarray
- scipy
- os
- pickle
- pandas
- tqdm
```

# Installation

1 - Clone STABLE repository.

 ```
git clone https://github.com/mikaslima/STABLE.git
  ```

2 - Verify you have installed all packages requiered for STABLE. If you use an Anaconda environment, please be sure you have activated the environment.

# Running the algorithm

## Input data

The code takes any resolution, regularly spaced data (tested with 2.5º, 1º, and 0.25º). Ideally, the name should be "Z500_(start year)_(end year)_(hemisphere)_(name of institution)" for example: "Z500_1940_2023_NH_ECMWF.nc". The variable names inside the file should be "z" for the geopotential at 500 hPa in units of [m], "time" as datetime format [YYYY-MM-DD], "lat", and "lon" for the coordinates in degrees.

In this release, you can find a 2-year (2019-2020) dataset from NCAR, at 2.5º resolution, for the Northern Hemisphere, ready to run. This example data returns a catalogue that can be seen in the ```Data/Output_data```. Additionally, example figures are shown in ```Figures```. Larger 80-year datasets are available at [![Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13891996](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zenodo-10.5281/zenodo.13891996-blue)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13891996).

## Code

The ```Algorithm``` itself is divided in 3 major steps/scripts: Daily structure identification, structure tracking in time, and production of the catalogues with general statistic (by daily observation, event) and the respective observation masks.
In each of these, the preamble contains a set of variables to be changed by the user in the "Data/Input_data/namelist_input.txt" file (see description below).
These codes may have significant departures from the MATLAB application of [Sousa et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0658.1), the ones I considered are marked as such in the code.
To run successfully the code please edit the namelist according to your needs and run the scripts in succession.
